 * Wait for a beat/story's illustration before revealing its text + image
 * TOGETHER (one clean simultaneous reveal, no text-then-image-pop-in layout
 * shift). The child NEVER hangs on the waiting screen — the safeguards:
 *
 *  - images OFF (`imageEnabled=false`) → no wait, reveal immediately with the
 *    neutral soft field;
 *  - generation FAILS (or returns no path) → reveal text with the neutral
 *    field (never wait forever);
 *  - the image is "ready" only when it is BROWSER-DECODED, not merely when the
 *    server returns a path: we preload it (`new Image()` + `decode()`/`onload`)
 *    and reveal on a successful decode so the <img> can't pop in after the text;
 *    a decode error reveals text + neutral field;
 *  - MAX-WAIT TIMEOUT (`timeoutMs`, ~45s) races all of the above → if nothing
 *    settled by then, reveal text + neutral field anyway; a late image may still
 *    swap in (decoded) if it arrives afterwards.
 *
 * This is a DISPLAY/LOADER-layer gate only: it calls the existing background
 * `fetchImage` (generateSegmentImageFn) — the server generation contract is
 * unchanged.

 * mount) reuses this same promise and its OWN handler — closing over effect#2's
 * live `unmounted`/`fetchStartedAt` — delivers the image when it resolves (~60s).
 * Without the shared promise, only effect#1's (dead) handler would see the
 * result and discard it, and the live mount would never get the image.
 *
 * It deliberately lives OUTSIDE the component and is NOT cleared by an effect
 * cleanup: a dev double-mount's cleanup runs BEFORE the second mount's effect,
 * so an effect-scoped ref would be cleared in between. The entry is deleted by
 * the OWNER exactly once, after the fetch settles, so a genuinely-new key still
