/**
 * Disk-serve route for locally stored generated media: the web half of the
 * local-disk backend in media-store.ts. When BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN is absent
 * (self-hosted Docker / offline dev), `saveMedia` writes DATA_DIR/media/<file>
 * and stores the `/data/media/<file>` web path — this route is what actually
 * serves those bytes back to the browser.
 *
 * All path handling goes through `readStoredMediaBytes` (the single
 * choke-point): only `/data/media/…` shapes resolve, and anything escaping the
 * media dir (`/data/media/../../.env`) is rejected → 404 here.
 *
 * Filenames are nanoid-unique and never overwritten (see saveMedia), so a
 * served file is immutable → long-lived immutable cache header.
